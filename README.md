•Conducted extensive Exploratory Data Analysis to understand the classification dataset, identify trends, and prepare data for modeling 
by removing null values and addressing the class imbalance. 
• Trained and evaluated multiple machine learning models, including linear regression, random forest, and SVR, achieving a 20% 
reduction in prediction error.
• Applied one-hot encoding to optimize model performance, significantly improving prediction accuracy and model robustness
